## Features

- **Manual Production**: Click to make rubberbands and earn your first dollars.
- **Resource Management**: Manage your raw rubber supply. Hire **Auto-Buyers** to keep your stock replenished automatically.
- **Industrial Revolution**: Progress through tiers of machinery:
  - **Bander & MAX-Bander**: Basic automation.
  - **MEGA-Bander**: Hardcore industrial output.
  - **Nano-Swarms**: Self-replicating manufacturing clouds.
  - **Quantum Bander**: Probabilistic production from the quantum realm.
  - **Temporal Press**: Why make it now when you can have already made it?
- **Supply Chain Mastery**: Secure your own raw material sources:
  - **Rubbertree Plantations**: Sustainable organic sourcing.
  - **Synthetic Rubber Factories**: Industrial chemical synthesis.
  - **Black Hole Extruders**: Harvest matter directly from singularities.
- **Self-Replication**: Build **Production Lines** that manufacture your machines for you, creating exponential growth independent of money.
- **Research & Tech**: Unlock efficiency upgrades and deep technologies like **Robotics**, **Nanotechnology**, **Quantum Mechanics**, and **Singularity Theory**.
- **Marketing & Psychology**: Increase demand through **Online Marketing**, **Hyperpersonalisation**, and eventual **Mass Hypnosis** and **Mind Control**.
- **Complex Economy**:
  - **Market Fluctuations**: Prices for rubber and rubberbands shift over time.
  - **Maintenance Costs**: Machines and facilities cost money to run every tick.
  - **Inventory Costs**: Storing massive amounts of rubber or product incurs increasing fees.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
